## Tech stack
1. React.js
2. TailwindCSS (styling)
3. Redux (state management)


## Elements that i have done well
1. Added proper components based approach for creating app.
2. Routing for public and private routes.
3. Redux setup (used generic functions to create action types and actions).
4. Used debouncing technique(generic function) to search movies.


If had some more hours, will add caching for required functions and improve the styling for components.
